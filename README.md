# 3D-theme-for-chrome
This JavaScript code uses **Three.js** to create a 3D interactive UI with animated geometric graphs based on virtual windows. It includes a **search widget**, a **shortcut bar** with quick links, and smooth animations. The scene responds to mouse movements, with idle animations after 5 seconds of inactivity.
