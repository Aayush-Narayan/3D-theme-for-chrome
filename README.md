# 3D-theme-for-chrome
This JavaScript code uses **Three.js** to create a 3D interactive UI with animated geometric graphs based on virtual windows. It includes a **search widget**, a **shortcut bar** with quick links, and smooth animations. The scene responds to mouse movements, with idle animations after 5 seconds of inactivity.

# 3D New Tab Theme Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a custom 3D scene. The scene features animated cubes and dynamic window management using **Three.js**. It tracks window sizes and positions and stores them in **localStorage**.

## Features

- **Custom 3D Background**: Displays animated cubes and dynamic visuals when opening a new tab.
- **Window Management**: Tracks and saves window positions and sizes, updates across sessions.
- **Interactive UI**: The scene reacts to window size changes and smooth animations.
- **Idle Detection**: Animations change when the user is idle.

## Installation

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-new-tab-theme.git
   ```

2. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

3. **Enable Developer Mode** (top-right).

4. **Click 'Load unpacked'** and select the project folder.

5. **Open a New Tab** to see the 3D scene in action.

## File Structure

```
3d-new-tab-theme/
├── manifest.json            # Extension manifest file
├── index.html               # HTML for the new tab page
├── main.js                  # Main JavaScript file with Three.js logic
├── WindowManager.js         # Window management class
├── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
└── README.md                # Project README
```
## HOW TO IMPLEMENT:
To make your Chrome extension's new tab page the default when opening a new tab, you just need to install it via Developer Mode and Chrome will use your custom index.html from the extension.

- 🔧 Steps to Set Your New Tab Extension as Default
- Zip Your Extension Files

Include:

manifest.json

index.html

main.js

Any other JS/CSS/assets you use

- Go to Chrome Extensions

- Navigate to chrome://extensions/

- Enable Developer Mode (top-right toggle)

- Load Your Extension

- Click "Load unpacked"

- Select the folder containing your extension

- Open a New Tab

Chrome will now open your index.html as the new tab page.

## Note:
🔐 Chrome only allows one extension to override the new tab at a time. If another one is active, it may override yours.

## Permissions

- The extension uses no special permissions except for controlling the new tab page.

## How It Works

- **`manifest.json`**: Configures the Chrome extension to override the new tab with a custom page (`index.html`).
- **`index.html`**: Sets up the HTML structure for the new tab, loads Three.js, and includes `main.js` for 3D rendering.
- **`WindowManager.js`**: A custom JavaScript class that manages window size and position, storing and syncing data across sessions using `localStorage`.

## Key Functions

- **`WindowManager`**: Tracks window position and size, updating them in `localStorage`. It ensures that changes to window dimensions persist between sessions.
- **Three.js 3D Scene**: Animates cubes and creates dynamic visuals in the background using Three.js.

## Customization

- You can modify the **3D scene** in `main.js` by changing the objects, animations, or adding new elements.
- Update the **new tab UI** by customizing `index.html` and the associated CSS.
